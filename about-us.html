I am an 8th grader at Thomas Grover Middle School who loves coding because it lets me create websites and solve problems that help people. Mental health really matters to me and I care about making sure everyone feels supported and understood, getting the help they need as well. In my free time, I love to sleep, watch movies, do classical dance and listen to songs. I hope to go in the medical field in the future since I want to support patients and make a difference in their life through care and technology.

I am currently a student at Thomas Grover MIddle School in Princeton Junction, NJ. I like to code and have experience with Python, C++, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My favorite subject in school is math because of its abstractness. I enjoys swimming and reading in his free time and have enjoyed watching Stranger Things on Netflix. I will graduate high school in 2030 and I hope I will move on to make the world a better place using technology and coding.
