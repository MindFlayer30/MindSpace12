<h1>Pause. Breathe. You are Doing Enough.</h1>

<p>
  A quiet space to slow down, reflect, and take care of your mental well-being.
</p>


<p>
  You do not need to fix everything today.
  Your feelings are valid.
  Taking a pause is productive.
</p>

<h2>What You Can Do Here</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Take a mindful pause</li>
  <li>Reflect on your day</li>
  <li>Read gentle reminders for self-care</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Take one deep breath and begin when you are ready.
</h2>

<p>
Sit with a straight back or lie down, ensuring muscles are relaxed.
</p>


<p>
 Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and hold for 4 seconds. Repeat for several minutes to regulate oxygen and reduce stress.
<p>

<p>
Breathe in for 3 seconds, hold for 3 seconds, and exhale for 3 seconds to quickly manage acute anxiety.
</p>

<p>
YOU ARE IN A SAFE SPACE TO CONTINUE YOUR MINFUL JOURNEY.
<p>

<h3>
Acknowledge Your Current State:
</h3>

Without judgment, notice any tension in your shoulders, jaw, or chest.
Release and Soften: As you exhale,  drop your shoulders and unclench your jaw. Allow the weight of your body to be supported by whatever you are sitting or lying on.
<p>


<h3>
Gentle Reminders For This Moment
</h3>

<p>
- Taking this time out for yourself is not a waste, it is essential for your mental health.
<p>

<p>
- You are enough. Just being here and being present in enough.
<p>

<p>
- Take one step at a time. Focus only on the next few minutes.
<p>

<h4>
If you're ready for the next step, reflect and ask youself, "What does my body need right now that I can give myself?"</h4>

<h3>
As you finish up with the exercises, carry this sense of calmness within you to your next task, knowing you can return to this at any time.</h3>
